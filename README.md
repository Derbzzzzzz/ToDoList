# ToDoList
Simple ToDoList website made using webpack. Learnt how to make more involved code along with using modules. In hindsight, I would use more modularization and implement object oriented principles better into the project

# Deployment
The website is hosted [here](https://derbzzzzzz.github.io/ToDoList/)
