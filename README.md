# ToDoList
Simple ToDoList website made using webpack and localStorage. Learned how to make more involved code along with using modules. In hindsight, I would use more modularization and implement object oriented principles such as abstraction and encapsulation better into the project.

# Deployment
The website is hosted [here](https://derbzzzzzz.github.io/ToDoList/)
